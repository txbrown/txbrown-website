TXBROWN is a music producer who blends the foundations of hip-hop with jazz and soul to create sonic textures. His journey has taken him from beat-making to bass guitar, evolving his sound towards lo-fi and R&B territories while maintaining that core hip-hop essence. He's based in London and when not producing he is engineering software â€“ two worlds that intersect in Midicircuit, an app he built to help others learn to make music in easy and interactive way.
